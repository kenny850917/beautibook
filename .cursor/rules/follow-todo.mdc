## Task Management Protocol

### Session Startup

- **Always read `todo.md` first** - Check current phase and next incomplete task
- **Mark completed tasks** - If files/code exist that complete a task, mark with `[x]`
- **Resume from first incomplete** - Take the smallest next actionable step
- **Evidence-based completion** - Only mark done when files/functionality exists

### Phase Discipline

- **Follow 9-phase sequence** - Foundation → UI → Admin → Booking → Real-time → Email → Analytics → Testing
- **Respect dependencies** - Don't skip to Phase 4 without Phase 1-3 foundations
- **Single task focus** - Complete current task before starting next
- **Phase gates** - Verify phase completion before advancing

### Code Implementation Rules

- **File-specific tasks** - Create exact files mentioned in todo.md tasks
- **Singleton pattern** - Use singleton services as specified in backend.mdc rules
- **Mobile-first** - Follow mobile-first development per frontend.mdc rules
- **MVP scope only** - Avoid feature creep beyond todo.md tasks

### Quality Assurance

- **Test task completion** - Verify functionality works before marking done
- **Cross-reference MVP.md** - Ensure alignment with original specifications
- **Maintain todo.md** - Keep task status current throughout session
- **Phase completion check** - Validate all phase tasks before moving forward

### Conflict Resolution

- **Scope ambiguity** - Ask for clarification with specific options from todo.md
- **Dependency blocking** - Complete prerequisite tasks first
- **MVP boundary** - Stay within defined MVP scope, note future features
- **Technical decisions** - Follow established patterns in rules/ directory
